      <p>You ever make what you think is a good amount of spaghetti and then you realize woah thats way too much who's going to eat that? and then you ask your roommates and like no one wants this extra gallon of spaghetti so you just kinda have to down it because you know if that goes in the fridge its not coming out.</p>
      <p>but like they never give you a way of making sure you have your proper serving of spaghetti you know? it feels like they just want you to buy more, maybe next time ill make less but you and me both know that wont happen.</p>

    content: `
      <p>Today I did a code review at a coffee shop. The barista asked what I was doing and I tried to explain what a pull request is. She nodded politely but I could tell she was thinking "this guy needs to get a life."</p>
      <p>Jokes on her though, I was getting paid to drink coffee and look at code. Who's the real winner here?</p>
