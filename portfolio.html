			<h2> <b>Who are you?</b> </h1>
			<p> i am savan </p>
			<h2> <b>No but like actually</b> </h1>
			<p> I'm a Computer Science Major with a minor in Statistics and Mathematics! I graduate in May 2022 from NC State University. I love cooking, ping pong, and collecting books that I say I'll read but never will.</p>
			<h2> <b> Do you have any experience? </b> </h2>
			<p> I've done software enginnering internships with Fidelity Investments, The Vanguard Group, and Amazon. They've all been pretty cool. </p>
			<h2> <b> Okay but what experience do you have outside traditional work? </b> </h2>
			<p> You're a very curious person huh? I'm part of the board for the NC State Hackathon PackHacks, I'm also an Ambassador for the NC State Computer Science Department, and I TA our Intro to Java Course. 
			I used to also teach the Android section of our App Development Club </p>
			<h2> <b> What's your dream company? </b> </h2>
			<p> Your's of course! It's truly has everything I'm looking for and I wouldn't look anywhere else if I got an offer </p>
			<h2> <b> What are you interests you about Computer Science? </b></h2>
			<p> <s> money</s> So one day I'm in Mexico right, and let me tell you I've never had a better taco then at this one street cart they take it right off this rottiserie thing and its absolutely 
			delicious you have no idea, anyways I'm at a library because I love libraries and I'm talking about how theres so many kids here to this librarian. She goes "oh they're here because
			there's no wifi anywhere else". What? No wifi? So I go on my phone and I google it, did you know only 48% of the world has wifi?? We're talking about the worlds largest library of information
			here and only half of us have it??? The internet is this beautiful magnificent way of communication and learning its ESSENTIAL to most of our lives, and we've walled off half the world? Thats
			so beyond absurd, and I guess the point of my story is this: All my life I've been obsessed with math and learning and I just never could find the right way to apply it, and I believe with my full
			heart that this major is the way I can use what I know to solve problems I may not even know exist yet, and that makes me kind of excited. </p>
			<h2> <b> What are you up to now? </b> </h2>
			<p> I'm finishing up my junior year (very scary would not recommend) and I'm getting more into Artificial Intelligence, I took an Intro to AI course and loved it so I'm taking a grad school course on it
			next semester and maybe hopefully get to do some research? I'm also getting kinda good at making pasta from scratch so if you're reading this and come by to my dorm I can make you a sick taco or some pasta for your troubles </p>
