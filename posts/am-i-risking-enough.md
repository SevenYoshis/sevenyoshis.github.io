I feel like in my studies and career, the path I've been on has been really clear. I majored in Computer Science, and after that, I went to Google and got promoted to being mid-level, and then I left to Meta to try and become Senior. At 25 years old, I think I've soaked in every compliment a family member or family friend could give me, and while I wasn't doing it solely for that reason, I'd be lying if I said it wasn't at least half of it (the other half being $omething entirely $eperate). When you've squeezed out the validation you originally wanted and kind of plateaued in your quality of life financially, what do you do?


When you're a child of immigrants, you're brought up knowing the risks your parents took for you to be where you are, often more than once a day. However, you're also reminded constantly that the risk part of the bloodline ends with you: you will take on the safest, clearest route to financial success doing [insert affluent job here], guaranteeing class mobility for your middle to upper middle class family household, and repeat the cycle with your child ad nauseam.


I'm not saying this is a bad system by any means, over the course of thousands of years in India it's a very safe bet to say this is probably one of the top 0.01% of scenarios to be in, but I can't help but think after 3 years in the workforce, do I really have 30+ more years of this in me? At what point am I going to take a risk? 


For the first time in a long time (maybe high school?) I'm starting to believe getting into FAANG isn't the end goal and I'm scared of even having that thought. 

If I stay in the position I'm in I'm guaranteed "enough", and maybe that's the problem.
