Today I did a code review at a coffee shop. The barista asked what I was doing and I tried to explain what a pull request is. She nodded politely but I could tell she was thinking "this guy needs to get a life."

Jokes on her though, I was getting paid to drink coffee and look at code. Who's the real winner here?
