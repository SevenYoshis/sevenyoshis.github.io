being in nyc for the last 7 months has me reflecting a lot, i think im ready to start writing in public again. 
i feel like a lot of the benefit of posting on any platform is being able to get replies from people and maintaining the connections you have with them through tiny updates.

so when i dont post i dont get to connect back with the people i know from sf or raleigh or charlotte etc. 
 
 i want a way to talk to all of you, you know? and in terms of reaching out to people i dont immediately live next to ive just never been good at maintaining that constant stream of communication. 

moving from sf to nyc has me thinking a lot about the habits we form in new cities, the new people we surround ourselves with, and the habits we lose. i guess im just tired of doing the things ive been doing the way ive been doing them.

nothing changes if nothing changes, ill write something better soon
