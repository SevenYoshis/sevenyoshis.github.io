If I could kidnap all my friends from San Francisco and force them to live in Midtown with me, I would. I was with a lot of them in Mexico City last month, and it had me at ease for the first time since I had moved. I didn’t fully realize it until the day after I landed back in New York, when I realized finding someone for dinner that night wasn’t something I could just schedule that day.

I’m not saying I’m constantly stressed in New York, but I’m definitely not around people I can fully relax with yet, and that comes with time.  The dance you have to do to meet people, though, it just **drains** the soul out of me. it’s just a thousand of 

what’s your name? what are your cross streets? where do you work?how long have you lived in the city?where did you live before here?do you know ______ ?whats your instagram?

We trade instagrams, maybe I ask to hangout once, and 99% of the time it’s a dead end, we never see each other again. Now I have to swipe an extra story every morning. Why? Is it worth the energy? Lets say we actually do end up hanging out again, is this one out of a hundred person going to be my next great friend?  

I find myself going to events I would never go to just for the hope of meeting these magical people. I get stressed in trying to squeeze the connection out of the partifuls I’m sent and I feel like that puts too much pressure on trying to make every event the event that goes so well that I can stop having to **go** to these events.  

Its not all doom and gloom though, the days are getting shorter now, winter is coming, and I now find myself with hobbies that keep me occupied socially. My volleyball class still hangs out with each other after the course ended every week and we have league teams made for the coming year. I also found a couple of poker games with people I enjoy talking to and don’t have me losing tons of money. I’m far from the comfort I had in San Francisco, but for the first time in a while, I see the pathway there, and that makes me kind of happy. 

It’s always easier to stay in the place you are with the people you have, but I think moving has forced me to grow in ways I would never have, and I think I have to see that through.
